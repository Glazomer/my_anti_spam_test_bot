#My antispam bot

##Usage
First, get bot token from **@BotFather**.\
Create `bot_token.py` file and insert `BOT_TOKEN = 'your_token_here'` and change `your_token_here` for token that **@BotFather** gave you.\
Install all dependencies used in `main.py` and run script.\
As long as script runs, bot works.

###Purpose
We had small chat for leetcoders, and got spammed sometimes, so I decided to make this bot.

###My experience
I am JS dev. This bot was created in one day by person who NEVER programmed in python.\
Today, 05/09/2020 I just watched some python videos (Derek) and googled how to make bot, that's it :)
